# am_agency_code_challenge

First of all, thank you for your considering me for the position:

Rather then use one of Wordpress' default themes, I used a starter theme from https://underscores.me/, and then added a CDN for Bootstrap to give it basic CSS styles. 

All the code that's my work for this challenge, I commented as "=== AM CODE CHALLENGE ===" just so it's easier to find. 

The files I worked on specifically were:

functions.php
single-resource.php
archive-resource.php
content-search.php

For the filtering I went with an ajax call so there's no reload or page change. 

I created 11 posts to show pagination in action and the 10 item limit, however I didn't fill all ten pages with content. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions, and I look forward to the next steps, thank you!
